## Key Changes Reflected

### Backend Architecture
- Express.js 5.1.0 with TypeScript
- Dual database support (PostgreSQL/In-memory)
- Port 5001 (dev) / 10000 (production)
- API key authentication for admin routes

### Database Design
- PostgreSQL with JSONB for flexible data
- In-memory fallback for development
- Automatic schema initialization (dev only)
- Connection pooling with configurable limits

### Security Improvements
- No hardcoded API keys
- Header-only authentication
- Production fail-fast without required env vars
- Input validation on all endpoints

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints with consistent responses
- Proper HTTP methods (PATCH for partial updates)
- Pagination with limit/offset
- Status filtering for recommendations

## Removed/Updated Legacy Content

- Removed references to JWT authentication (not implemented)
- Updated incorrect endpoint methods (PUT â†’ PATCH)
- Fixed database schema to match actual implementation
- Removed placeholder values in favor of clear indicators
- Updated all code examples to match current implementation

## Documentation Consistency

All documentation now:
- Uses consistent terminology
- References correct file paths
- Includes working code examples
- Reflects actual implementation
- Provides clear setup instructions
- Includes troubleshooting guidance

## Next Steps

For future documentation updates:
1. Update version numbers when dependencies change
2. Add new endpoints as they're implemented
3. Update deployment URLs once services are live
4. Add performance metrics once collected
5. Include user feedback and common issues
